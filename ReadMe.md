## Introduction 
With the increased number of migrants coming to Europe, many of those coming from islamic countries are facing difficulties in choosing the right food products depending on the **"Halal Food"** rules, so instead of stand for long time reading the ingredients of each product before get it, such as (meat, sweets, chips..) that have **E-number** materials in its contents, a simple application is created to help finding out the right choice in a very easy way.
