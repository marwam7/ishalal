Hack your future graduation project

## Introduction 
While the increased number of refugees comming to Europe, I have noticed around me and in many of social media pages that most of them have difficulties in choosing the food products because they are used to eat what is called **"Halal Food"**, and I am one of those people who stand for long time reading the ingredients of each product before buying it, mostly meat, sweets and chips who have **E-number** materials in its contents, So why don't we create an easy useful way to help people in this issue!

*notice: Halal is an Arabic word that means "permissible." In terms of food, it means food that is permissible according to Islamic law. For a meat to be certified "halal," it cannot be dead by itself  or from pork.*
